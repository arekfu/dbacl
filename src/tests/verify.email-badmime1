None of the screens allow me to start a Project

Hello Eric,
Sorry for not providing a document along with the product,
actually i am working on the documents and soon it will be available for
download.
As of now i can help you out with some basic instructions:
1) Initiate a BITS instance in your ZMI.
2) BITS will by default have an acl_users folder within it, If you don't
want to use it and use the existing users in a acl_users folder at it's top
then please
 delete the acl_users folder within BITS.
3) Set the role Projectmanager to the users whom you want to give the
ability to add project
4) Set the roles (Developer,Teammember) or (Developer,Teamleader) to those
users who are going to participate in BITS.
Now you are ready with the configurations. Go to the view tab of bits and
create a project with a projectmanager and some team member.
And then you can keep adding and tracking BUGS in this project.
All the best
Cheers
