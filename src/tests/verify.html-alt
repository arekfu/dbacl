Secure Your Place In History! 
On January 30th 2004 a single individual will battle the largest chess playing 
 computer ever created!
ChessBrain is virtual supercomputer which plays using the processing power 
 of thousands of machines connected via the Internet.
You can help ChessBrain by running our free software and participating in 
this 
 Official Guiness World Record attempt. Every computer connected will help to 
 make ChessBrain stronger!
" It is similar to SETI@home .... The difference is that all that power 
 is used, not in the search for extra-terrestrial life or to fold proteins, 
but 
 to play the ancient game of chess. " - Linux.com
Everyone who participates will be eligible to receive a printed certificate 
 acknowledging their involvement!
ChessBrain has become the first distributed computer in history to play chess 
 using 846 computers from over 50 different countries.
